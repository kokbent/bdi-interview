# Background summary

- Mapping of malaria prevalence based on national malaria survey data

- Choices choices choices of models
  - Common approach: SPDE-INLA
  - Alternative: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
  - Alternative: Gradient Boosted Models/Trees (GBM)

- More choices: To include the past dataset or not (Spatial vs Spatiotemporal settings)

# Objectives

- To determine if GAM and state-of-the-art machine learning method (e.g. GBM), under both spatial and spatio-temporal setting, can be good alternatives to the more complicated SPDE method

- To determine if inclusion of past data is beneficial in modeling the current spatial distribution of malaria prevalence at the national scale

---
# Data

- Demographic Health Survey data from five countries

- Spatial covariates: free and publicly available remote sensing or GIS products

# Discussions

- No single best model, performance varies from setting to setting and country to country

- SPDE is consistent, but doesn't gain much from incorporating past data
  - Can deteriorate when past and present spatial dependency are very different
  
- GAM is good, fast and simple-to-use alternative, especially with more data
  - Dismal performance in irregularly shaped countries
  - High perimeter to root area ratio: Malawi 8.7, Uganda 5.7

- GBM unpredictable but generally fits well with more data available

- üè†üí¨ Fit multiple model or at least benchmark with GAM

# Distance / Travel time to health facilities

- Early diagnosis and treatment reduce death and transmission

- Many factors contribute to access to healthcare

- Distance or travel time to health facilities is important predictor to malaria prevalence *(e.g. Schoeps et al. 2011, Kizito et al. 2012)*

# Bunkpurugu-Yunyoo District, Ghana

.pull-left1[
- 1200 km $^2$ , 150K populations

- 2 urban centers, 8 health facilities

- Multiple years of malaria surveys in 2010 - 2014

- Important predictors *(Amratia et al. 2019; Millar et al. 2018)*
  - Distance to health facilities (HF)
  - Distance to urban centers

# Expansion of health services?

- Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS)

  - Run by trained community health officers (CHOs)
  
  - Assigned to community health post, services at doorstep
  
  - Treatment for malaria, acute respiratory diseases and other childhood illness
  
- Expand CHPS to all communities

---
# Prevalence vs Incidence

- Available Data: Prevalence under 5 years old

- Decision criteria: Incidence (of all ages)

- Conversion from prevalence under five to incidence of all ages
  - Prevalence ‚Üí Incidence not always linear, especially for older children and adults

---
# Objectives

- Determine the optimal locations for new health facilities based on district-wide malaria criteria:

  1. Overall malaria prevalence of children under 5, 
  
  2. Overall malaria incidence of all ages, and 
  
  3. Average travel time to nearest health facilities
  
- Two scenarios:

  1. Adding new health facilities to the set of existing health facilities
  
  2. Adding new health facilities in the absence of existing CHPS
  
---
# Methods

- Three years of high transmission season data (2010 to 2012)

- ~ 5000 children under five

- 71 to 80 villages per year

- GAM with 5 predictors
  - Travel time to HF, distance to urban center, elevation, NDVI, log population density
  
- Use Genetic Algorithm to find optimal locations given number of health facilities and criteria

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # Optimization -->

<!-- - Procedures: -->
<!--   - Add new facilit(ies) onto the map -->
<!--   - Recalculate travel time to nearest health facilities -->
<!--   - Use model to predict new sets of covariates -->
<!--   - Calculate district-wide metrics -->

<!-- - Specify number of health facilities and criteria -->

<!-- - Start in some random initial locations -->

<!-- - Use genetic algorithm to find locations that minimize metric -->

<!-- - Find one up to five optimal locations for each criteria -->

# Limitations

- Correlation $\ne$ causation

- Assume correlations and disease transmission dynamic remain unchanged 

- Prevalence ‚Üí Incidence based on model ensemble analysis of 30 sites in Sub-Saharan Africa from 1981 to 2011
  - Best estimate of incidence we can get

---
# Take home messages

- Different optimization criteria can produce very different results.

- Importance of using multiple optimization criteria in decision analysis.

- Decision analysis and interactive application are important tools for communicating models.

# Decision Support Tool to Predict Causes of Childhood Febrile Illness Using a Bayesian Model Approach

# Childhood Acute Febrile Illness (AFI)

.pull-left2[
- Malaria used to be the main cause of AFI in Africa

- With decline in malaria transmission, other etiologies such as bacterial infection can be increasingly prominent

- Difficulty in diagnosis, lack of test kit and prioritization of malaria can drive up misdiagnosis

- Predicting infection status based on symptoms, demographic variables and hematological variables

# Key findings

- The modified BMA is as accurate as random forest without losing its interpretability
  - Better than that of stepwise logistic regressions

- Provides predictor importance for each diagnostic test

- Can be incorporated into a relatively responsive interactive decision support tool

---
# Key findings

- All models performed well in malaria RDT and microscopy

  - Especially with hematological variables

- Poor predictive performance with Malaria TAC
  
  - Low sample size
  
  - Submicroscopic infection is asymptomatic ‚Üí Symptoms are not useful predictors

- Poor predictive performance with Blood culture
  
  - Low sample size
  
  - Multiple types of pathogens ‚Äì diverse signs and symptoms
  
  - Hematological variables provide no added value

---
# Conclusions

- Interpretable, flexible and yet accurate model created with goal to be incorporated into an interactive web application

- Need to test with more variety of dataset

- Current model framework assumes predictors missing at random, and diagnostic test outcomes are independent
