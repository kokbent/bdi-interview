# COVID-19 Transmission Model in Florida

- Spatially explicit agent-based model
  - Assess impact of intervention strategies (e.g. selective lockdown / closure of businesses)
  - Assess impact of vaccinations

- Synthetic populations

- Inference of time-varying parameters

# Synthetic Populations of Florida
.pull-left[
- 8.9m households, 20m persons, 2.4m workplaces

- Nursing homes, schools and hospitals

- Statistics and randomization
  - e.g. workplace sizes
  - e.g. 'gravity model' for connections

# Inference of time varying parameters

- State/county reported cases, hospitalization and death
- Report delay of test results (State line list)
- Social distancing metric (Safegraph cellphone tracking data)
