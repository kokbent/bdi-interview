# Prevalence vs Incidence

- Available Data: Prevalence under 5 years old

- Decision criteria: Incidence (of all ages)

- Conversion from prevalence under five to incidence of all ages
  - Prevalence â†’ Incidence not always linear, especially for older children and adults
  - Major limitation: meta-analysis does not always reflect the ground, but it is the best estimate we have
