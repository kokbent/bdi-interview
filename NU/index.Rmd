# Part I Improving National Level Spatial Mapping of Malaria through Alternative Spatial and Spatio-temporal Models

# Background summary

.pull-right1[
- Mapping of malaria prevalence based on national malaria survey data

- Choices choices choices of models
  - Common approach: SPDE-INLA
  - Alternative: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
  - Alternative: Gradient Boosted Models/Trees (GBM)

- More choices: To include the past dataset or not (Spatial vs Spatiotemporal settings)

# Objectives

- To determine if GAM and state-of-the-art machine learning method (e.g. GBM), under both spatial and spatio-temporal setting, can be good alternatives to the more complicated SPDE method

- To determine if inclusion of past data is beneficial in modeling the current spatial distribution of malaria prevalence at the national scale

---
# Data

- Demographic Health Survey data from five countries

- Spatial covariates: free and publicly available remote sensing or GIS products

# Discussions

.pull-left[
- No single best model, performance varies from setting to setting and country to country

- SPDE is consistent, but doesn't gain much from incorporating past data
  - Can deteriorate when past and present spatial dependency are very different

GAM is good, fast and simple-to-use alternative, especially with more data

But ...

# Discussions

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

- GAM: Dismal performance in irregularly shaped countries

- High perimeter to root area ratio: Malawi 8.7, Uganda 5.7

---
# Discussions

- GBM unpredictable but generally fits well with more data available

- üè†üí¨ Fit multiple model or at least benchmark with GAM

# Part II Interactive visualizer and simulator for decision support

# Interactive tools

- Bridging the gap between modelers and stakeholders

- Enhance understanding of the models by "using" them

- Informed decisions

- Increasingly easy to create: No longer requires in-depth knowledge in Javascript and CSS

# Placement of health facilities

- Early diagnosis and treatment reduce death and transmission

- Many factors contribute to access to healthcare

- Distance or travel time to health facilities is important predictor to malaria prevalence *(e.g. Schoeps et al. 2011, Kizito et al. 2012)*

---
# Bunkpurugu-Yunyoo District, Ghana

.pull-left1[
- 1200 km $^2$ , 150K populations

- 2 urban centers, 8 health facilities

- Multiple years of malaria surveys in 2010 - 2014

- Important predictors *(Amratia et al. 2019; Millar et al. 2018)*
  - Distance to health facilities (HF)
  - Distance to urban centers
]

.pull-right1[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

# Objectives

Determine the optimal locations for new health facilities based on district-wide malaria criteria:

  1. Overall malaria prevalence of children under 5, 
  
  2. Overall malaria incidence of all ages, and 
  
  3. Average travel time to nearest health facilities
  
---
# Methods

- Three years of high transmission season data (2010 to 2012)

- ~ 5000 children under five

- 71 to 80 villages per year

- GAM with 5 predictors
  - Travel time to HF, distance to urban center, elevation, NDVI, log population density

- Use Genetic Algorithm to find optimal locations given number of health facilities and criteria

---
# Results

See interactive visualizer and simulator created.

---
# Take home messages

- Different optimization criteria can produce very different results.

- Importance of using multiple optimization criteria in decision analysis.

- Decision analysis and interactive application are important tools for communicating models.

# Personal Protective Behaviour (PPB)

- Important part of COVID-19 transmission dynamic

- Using a simple 0-1 score to describe behavioural changes

- Intertwined with mobility, policy intervention, social distancing, hand washing, masking etc

- Affects disease transmissibility and inter-household interaction network in the model

- Time-varying, need to parameterize using proxy such as ‚Äúmobility index‚Äù
