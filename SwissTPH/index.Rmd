# Part I: Guiding placement of health facilities using malaria criteria and interactive tools

---
# Interactive tools

- Bridging the gap between modelers and stakeholders

- Enhance understanding of the models by "using" them

- Informed decisions

- Increasingly easy to create: No longer requires in-depth knowledge in Javascript and CSS

# Placement of health facilities

- Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduce death and transmission

- Many factors contribute to access to healthcare

- Distance or travel time to health facilities is important predictor to malaria prevalence *(e.g. Schoeps et al. 2011, Kizito et al. 2012)*

# Bunkpurugu-Yunyoo District, Ghana

.pull-left1[
- 1200 km $^2$ , 150K populations

- 2 urban centers, 8 health facilities

- Multiple years of malaria surveys in 2010 - 2014

- Important predictors *(Amratia et al. 2019; Millar et al. 2018)*
  - Distance to health facilities (HF)
  - Distance to urban centers
]

# Objectives

Determine the optimal locations for new health facilities based on district-wide malaria criteria:

  1. Overall malaria prevalence of children under 5, 
  
  2. Overall malaria incidence of all ages, and 
  
  3. Average travel time to nearest health facilities
  
---
# Methods

- Three years of high transmission season data (2010 to 2012)

- ~ 5000 children under five

- 71 to 80 villages per year

- GAM with 5 predictors
  - Travel time to HF, distance to urban center, elevation, NDVI, log population density

- Use Genetic Algorithm to find optimal locations given number of health facilities and criteria

---
# Results

See interactive visualizer and simulator created.

---
# Take home messages

- Different optimization criteria can produce very different results.

- Importance of using multiple optimization criteria in decision analysis.

- Decision analysis and interactive application are important tools for communicating models.
