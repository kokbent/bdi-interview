# Mapping malaria

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/malaria-risk-bf-intro.png")
```

---
# Ingredients

- National Malaria Survey Data

- Spatial predictors

  - Temperature
  - Rainfall
  - Nighttime lights
  - Accessibility to urban centers
  - Elevation
  - etc.

--

- And a model...

---
# Choice of Model

- Most common approach: Gaussian Process Model
  - Points close to the observed data point should share similar prevalence

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/gp-correl.gif")
```

  - Time consuming as sampling point large
  - Commonly approximated using Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) + Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)

---
# Alternative model?

- Spatial smoothing using Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
  - An underlying smoothed "landscape" unexplained by the covariates

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/gam-smoothed.png")
```

---
# Machine learning?

- Decision tree

# Borrow strength from the past?

- More and more countries now have multiple years of national malaria survey data.
  - e.g. Burkina Faso 2010 vs 2014

- Spatial vs Spatiotemporal setting

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/temporal-choice.png")
```

---
# Objectives

- To determine if GAM and state-of-the-art machine learning method (e.g. GBM), under both spatial and spatio-temporal setting, can be good alternatives to the more complicated SPDE method

- To determine if inclusion of past data is beneficial in modeling the current spatial distribution of malaria prevalence at the national scale

---
# Model comparison

- Ten-fold cross-validation

- 4 models (SPDE, GAM, GBM and stepwise logistic regression)

- 2 settings (Spatial vs Spatiotemporal)

- 5 countries (Burkina Faso, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Uganda)

- 2 metrics (Log-likelihood and Mean Absolute Error, MAE)

# Discussions

.pull-left1[
- SPDE performance is consistent, but no improvement when borrowing strength from the past

- Formulation assumes similar past and present spatial dependency
  - Can be horribly wrong...

# Discussions
.pull-left1[
- GAM performs on par with SPDE, especially with more data
  - Good, fast and simple to use alternative

- Splines can have unexpected behaviours at the edges

- Dismal performance in irregularly shaped countries
  - e.g. high perimeter to root area ratio

# Malaria treatment

- The most famous antimalarial drug is... Chloroquine

--

- But currently, the state-of-the-art drug is the *Artemisinin (Qinghaosu, ÈùíËíøÁ¥†)* and derivatives.

- First isolated in 1972 by Tu Youyou (Â±†Âë¶Âë¶) and members of *Project 523*

- Awarded 2015 Nobel Prize in Medicine

# Guiding placement of health facilities using malaria criteria and interactive tool

# Accessibility to health facility and malaria prevalence

- Early diagnosis and treatment reduce transmission and death

- Many factors contribute to accessibility to health facilities

- Distance or travel time to health facilities is important predictor to malaria prevalence

---
# Bunkpurugu-Yunyoo District, Ghana

.pull-left1[
- Malaria prevalence range 19% to 90%

- Important predictors
  - Distance to health facilities (HF)
  - Distance to urban centers
  - Elevation, vegetation index, population density
]

# Expansion of health services?

- Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS)
  - Run by trained community health officers (CHOs)
  - Assigned to community health post, services at doorstep
  - Treatment for malaria, acute respiratory diseases and other childhood illness
  
- Expand CHPS to all communities

- Major indicators: Mortality rate, maternal and children health

---
# Objectives

- Determine the optimal locations for new health facilities based on district-wide malaria criteria:
  1. Overall malaria prevalence of children under 5, 
  2. Overall malaria incidence of all ages, and 
  3. Average travel time to nearest health facilities
  
- Multi-layer problem: Map, model, population distribution, prevalence vs incidence

---
# Prevalence vs Incidence

- Prevalence (0 to 1): snapshot of the population at a single point in time

- Incidence (# per person-year): number of instances during a given period in the population of interest

- Conversion from prevalence under five to incidence of all ages
  - Prevalence ‚Üí Incidence not always linear, especially for older children and adults

---
# Methods

- Three years of high transmission season data (2010 to 2012)

- ~ 5000 children under five, 71 to 80 villages per year

- 5 predictors
  - Travel time to HF, distance to urban center, elevation, NDVI, log population density
  
- GAM with splines on elevation

---
# Optimization

- Procedures:
  - Add new facilit(ies) onto the map
  - Recalculate travel time to nearest health facilities
  - Use model to predict new sets of covariates
  - Calculate district-wide metrics
  
- Genetic algorithm

- Find one up to five optimal locations for each criteria

- Consider two scenario:
  1. New facilities on top of existing ones
  2. "Remove" existing CHPS, then add new facilities on top

# Interactive visualizer and simulator

- Interactive visualizers extremely common in this pandemic

- Interactive contents can be more engaging than static graphics

- Interactive simulator allows users to interact, use and experiment with the models

- Communicate complex analyses

- Creating interactive web applications and maps are increasingly streamlined
  - Does not require extensive knowledge of HTML and Javascript
