# Mapping malaria

- Malaria risk map guides efficient resource allocation for intervention program 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/malaria-risk-bf-intro.png")
```

---
# Ingredients

- National Malaria Survey Data

- Spatial predictors

  - Temperature
  - Rainfall
  - Nighttime lights
  - Accessibility to urban centers
  - Elevation
  - etc.

--

- And a model...

---
# Choice of Model

- Most common approach: Gaussian Process Model
  - Points close to the observed data point should share similar prevalence

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/gp-correl.gif")
```

  - Time consuming as sampling point large
  - Commonly approximated using Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) + Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)

---
# Alternative model?

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/spde-gamgbm-length.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
- SPDE-INLA is complicated

- Can we use faster and simpler alternatives instead?
]

---
# Alternative model 1

- Spatial smoothing using Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
  - An underlying smoothed "landscape" unexplained by the covariates

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/gam-smoothed.png")
```

---
# Alternative model 2: Machine learning

- Decision-trees ensemble methods
  - E.g. Random forests, gradient boosting tree/method (GBM)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/gbm-schema3.png")
```

---
# Borrow strength from the past?

- More and more countries now have multiple years of national malaria survey data.
  - e.g. Burkina Faso 2010 vs 2014

- Spatial vs Spatiotemporal setting

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/temporal-choice.png")
```

---
# Objectives

- To determine if GAM and state-of-the-art machine learning method (e.g. GBM), under both spatial and spatio-temporal setting, can be good alternatives to the more complicated SPDE method

- To determine if inclusion of past data is beneficial in modeling the current spatial distribution of malaria prevalence at the national scale

---
# Data

- Demographic Health Survey data from five countries

- Spatial covariates: free and publicly available remote sensing or GIS products

# Discussions

- No single best model, performance varies from setting to setting and country to country

- SPDE is consistent, but doesn't gain much from incorporating past data
  - Can deteriorate when past and present spatial dependency are very different
  
- GAM is good, fast and simple-to-use alternative, especially with more data
  - Dismal performance in irregularly shaped countries
  - High perimeter to root area ratio: Malawi 8.7, Uganda 5.7

---
# Discussions

- GBM unpredictable but generally fits well with more data available

- Fit multiple model or at least benchmark with GAM

- But currently, the state-of-the-art drug is the *Artemisinin (Qinghaosu, ÈùíËíøÁ¥†)* and derivatives.

# Expansion of health services?

- Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS)
  - Run by trained community health officers (CHOs)
  - Assigned to community health post, services at doorstep
  - Treatment for malaria, acute respiratory diseases and other childhood illness
  
- Expand CHPS to all communities

---
# Prevalence vs Incidence

- Prevalence (0 to 1): snapshot of the population at a single point in time

- Incidence (per person-year): number of instances during a given period in the population of interest

- Have: Prevalence under 5 years old

- Want: Incidence (of all ages)

- Conversion from prevalence under five to incidence of all ages
  - Prevalence ‚Üí Incidence not always linear, especially for older children and adults

---
# Objectives

- Determine the optimal locations for new health facilities based on district-wide malaria criteria:
  1. Overall malaria prevalence of children under 5, 
  2. Overall malaria incidence of all ages, and 
  3. Average travel time to nearest health facilities
  
---
# Methods

- Three years of high transmission season data (2010 to 2012)

- ~ 5000 children under five, 71 to 80 villages per year

- GAM with 5 predictors
  - Travel time to HF, distance to urban center, elevation, NDVI, log population density

---
# Optimization

<!-- - Procedures: -->
<!--   - Add new facilit(ies) onto the map -->
<!--   - Recalculate travel time to nearest health facilities -->
<!--   - Use model to predict new sets of covariates -->
<!--   - Calculate district-wide metrics -->
  
- Specify number of health facilities and criteria

- Start in some random intial locations

- Use genetic algorithm to find locations that minimize metric

- Find one up to five optimal locations for each criteria

- Provides predictor importance for each diagnostic test; Interpretable

- Can be incorporated into a relatively responsive interactive decision support tool
